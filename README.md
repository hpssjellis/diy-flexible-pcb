# Open Source DIY-flexible-PCB-biosensor Misison Statement

Using an Arduino Style microcontroller (I use the $5 USD Seeeduino XIAO and the $105 USD Arduino PortentaH7) and any electronic equipment, Kapton tape, thin silicon sheets, thin bare and insulated copper wire, 22 AWG bare copper wire, copper foil, soldering equipment and soldering paste and possibly a glue gun, Flexible Silver Ink Paste and/or conductive ink (The Bare brand is water soluble?), and perhaps some senosr modules can we DIY make inexpensive flexible BioSensors that compare favorably quality data collection of professional products?

Probably not, but why not try!

# Newcomers please check the issues and comment if you have any suggestions.


Note: Copper might not be the best metal for flexible (moist environment) biosensors, perhaps gold is a better metal. (Why can't it be cheap!)



Check the builds folder for the latest dated builds.



## Background

Several manufactor are making flexible PCB's, but like all PCB's unless you make your own expect at least a 7 day wait and perhaps much more between iterations of your prototype. For testing BioSensors we proabbly don't need an entire chip on a flexible sheet, since we can attach a small arduino type mircocontroller with battery fairly easily. So the issue becomes how to moust a sensor on a flexible subtrate with perhaps a few inflexible componenets.

Your final product will be manufactored because it si so cheap, but your prototypes might be more efficient to make them yourselves. That is what this repository with ISSUES is all about.
