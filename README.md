# Open Source DIY-flexible-PCB-biosensor Misison Statement

Using an Arduino Style microcontroller (I use the $5 USD Seeeduino XIAO and the $105 USD Arduino PortentaH7) and any electronic equipment, Kapton tape, thin silicon sheets, thin bare and insulated copper wire, 22 AWG bare copper wire, copper foil, soldering equipment and soldering paste and possibly a glue gun, Flexible Silver Ink Paste and/or conductive ink (The Bare brand is water soluble?), and perhaps some senosr modules can we DIY make inexpensive flexible BioSensors that compare favorably quality data collection of professional products?

Probably not, but why not try!
